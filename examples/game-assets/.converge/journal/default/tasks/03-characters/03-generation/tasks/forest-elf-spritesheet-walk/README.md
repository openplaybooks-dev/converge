| `NEEDS.result.md` | Input evaluation (files found, blocked/ready) |
| `TASK.md` | Task instructions for the AI |
| `CHECK.md` | Check spec (ids, commands) |
| `CHECK.result.md` | Check outcomes after execution (pass/fail, output state) |
| `LEARN.md` | Failure analysis from previous attempt (attempt 2+) |
| `data/needs.json` | Machine-readable needs (inputs, outputs, blocked state) |
| `data/check.json` | Machine-readable check definitions |
| `data/facts.json` | Facts collected during execution |

## How to run / resume

```bash
pnpm converge run --step   # run next pending task
pnpm converge run          # run all remaining tasks
```

## Verify checks manually

```bash
  python -c "from PIL import Image; im=Image.open('assets/characters/forest-elf/spritesheets/walk/walk.png'); w,h=im.size; assert w==h, f'not square: {im.size}'; assert w>=256 and w%4==0, f'expected 4x4 grid (square, side>=256, divisible by 4): {im.size}'"

  test -s assets/characters/forest-elf/spritesheets/walk/walk.prompt.txt
```
