  task: Directory-level git mv of packages/core/src/scheduler/ (from PR4) into packages/scheduler/. Plus ensure-epic-checkpoints.ts. Clean extraction.
  spec: "Create `packages/scheduler/` workspace package. Because PR4 put `scheduler/*` in its final shape already, this PR is a directory-level `git mv` with zero reshuffle.\n\n**Source (git mv):**\n- `packages/core/src/scheduler/*` → `packages/scheduler/src/*`\n- `packages/core/src/checkpoint/ensure-epic-checkpoints.ts` → `packages/scheduler/src/ensure-epic-checkpoints.ts`\n\n**Deps:**\n- `@converge/journal` (workspace:*) — for `CheckpointManager`, `constructJournalPath`\n- `@converge/core` (workspace:*) — for shared types (post-PR12 slim core)\n\n**Exports:**\n- `findNextTask`, `buildTaskTree`, `getTaskStates`, `calculateExecutionPlan`\n- `ensureEpicCheckpoints`\n- Types: `TaskNode`, `WbsProgress`, `TaskStates`, `ExecutionSpan`, `NextTaskResult`\n\n**Core side:**\n- `packages/core/package.json` adds `\"@converge/scheduler\": \"workspace:*\"`\n- Update import sites: `../scheduler/X` → `@converge/scheduler`\n- `packages/core/src/scheduler/` directory deleted\n- `packages/core/src/checkpoint/` directory deleted (empty post-ensure-epic-checkpoints move)\n\n**Layering audit:**\n```bash\n# Scheduler depends only on journal + core types\ngrep -rn \"@converge/\" packages/scheduler/src | grep -vE \"@converge/(journal|core)\" && exit 1 || true\n```\n\n**Acceptance:**\n- PR1 scheduler suites still pass (imports re-resolve to `@converge/scheduler`)\n- swebench + tbench tests green\n- `@converge/scheduler` tests pass in isolation\n- `pnpm -r build` + `pnpm -r test` green\n- `madge --circular packages/scheduler/src` — no cycles"

# Plan implementation — PR10 — Extract @converge/scheduler workspace package

Read the analysis and produce a concrete, file-level implementation plan.

## Steps

1. Read `D:/converge/.converge/artifacts/split-cli/011-extract-scheduler-pkg/analyze/plan.md`.
2. Reconcile the analysis against current code state — the analysis may have been written minutes or hours ago, but files may have drifted. Re-check line ranges and grep counts if they're load-bearing.
3. Write the final implementation plan. Be specific: file paths, exact lines, what becomes what.

## Output

Write `D:/converge/.converge/artifacts/split-cli/011-extract-scheduler-pkg/implement/plan.md`:

```markdown
# PR10 — Extract @converge/scheduler workspace package — Implementation Plan

## Summary
<one line>

## Changes (ordered)
1. File: `packages/core/src/...` — <create | move | edit | delete>; what
2. File: `packages/core/src/...` — ...

## Order of Operations
1. Do X first because Y depends on it
2. Then Z

## Post-change verification commands
- `pnpm --filter @converge/core build`
- `pnpm --filter @converge/core test`
- <any smoke checks specific to this PR>
