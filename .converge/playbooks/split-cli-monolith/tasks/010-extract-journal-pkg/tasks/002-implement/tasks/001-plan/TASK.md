  task: "Move journal, checkpoint, storage into their own package. Rename journal/navigator.ts → navigator-reader.ts to avoid grep collision with @converge/navigator."
  spec: "Create `packages/journal/` workspace package. High import churn (~40 sites).\n\n**Source (git mv):**\n- `packages/core/src/journal/*` → `packages/journal/src/journal/`\n- `packages/core/src/checkpoint/*` → `packages/journal/src/checkpoint/`\n- `packages/core/src/storage/*` → `packages/journal/src/storage/`\n\n**Rename (IMPORTANT):**\n- `journal/navigator.ts` (journal-side reader) → `journal/navigator-reader.ts`\n\nReason: `@converge/navigator` (PR3b) and `journal/navigator.ts` will otherwise be confusable in grep, IDE search, and stack traces. Rename to `navigator-reader.ts` before extraction so the name collision never exists in the new package.\n\n**Deps:** `zod` only.\n\n**Exports:**\n- `CheckpointManager`, `TaskCheckpointManager`, `UnitCheckpointManager`\n- `SessionLogger`\n- `FilesystemStorage`\n- `constructJournalPath`\n- `JournalCleanup`\n- (navigator-reader stays internal unless a consumer needs it)\n\n**Caveat — ensure-epic-checkpoints.ts:**\n\n`packages/core/src/checkpoint/ensure-epic-checkpoints.ts` imports from `scheduler/` (post-PR4). Moving it into `@converge/journal` would create a journal → scheduler dep, which inverts the onion (journal is more primitive than scheduler). \n\n**Resolution:** leave `ensure-epic-checkpoints.ts` in `packages/core/src/scheduler/` (not in this PR's move). PR10 moves it to `@converge/scheduler` along with the rest of scheduler.\n\n**Codemod for imports:**\n\n~40 sites import from journal/checkpoint/storage. Use `sed -i` or ts-morph to rewrite:\n- `../journal/X` → `@converge/journal` (for internal paths, pick the barrel export)\n- `../checkpoint/X` → `@converge/journal`\n- `../storage/X` → `@converge/journal`\n\nFind them: `grep -rln \"from.*['\\\"]\\\\.\\\\.*/(journal|checkpoint|storage)/\" packages/core/src`\n\n**Acceptance:**\n- `journal/navigator.ts` no longer exists; `journal/navigator-reader.ts` does\n- swebench + tbench tests green\n- `@converge/journal` tests pass in isolation\n- `pnpm -r build` + `pnpm -r test` green\n- `madge --circular packages/journal/src` — no cycles"

# Plan implementation — PR9 — Extract @converge/journal workspace package

Read the analysis and produce a concrete, file-level implementation plan.

## Steps

1. Read `D:/converge/.converge/artifacts/split-cli/010-extract-journal-pkg/analyze/plan.md`.
2. Reconcile the analysis against current code state — the analysis may have been written minutes or hours ago, but files may have drifted. Re-check line ranges and grep counts if they're load-bearing.
3. Write the final implementation plan. Be specific: file paths, exact lines, what becomes what.

## Output

Write `D:/converge/.converge/artifacts/split-cli/010-extract-journal-pkg/implement/plan.md`:

```markdown

## Changes (ordered)
1. File: `packages/core/src/...` — <create | move | edit | delete>; what
2. File: `packages/core/src/...` — ...

## Order of Operations
1. Do X first because Y depends on it
2. Then Z

## Post-change verification commands
- `pnpm --filter @converge/core build`
