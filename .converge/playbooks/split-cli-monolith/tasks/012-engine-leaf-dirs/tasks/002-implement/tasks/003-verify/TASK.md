# Verify implementation — PR11a — Extract @converge/engine: leaf dirs (no engine-to-engine fanout)

Quick verification that the PR's implementation doesn't break the build or tests.

## Steps

1. `cd D:/converge && pnpm typecheck` — fix any type errors introduced by this PR.
2. `cd D:/converge && pnpm test` — fix any test failures introduced by this PR.
3. If fixes are needed, apply them directly. Don't just report — converge.
