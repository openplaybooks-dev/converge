# Code review — {{title}}

Review the diff against the PR spec and acceptance criteria.

## Inputs

- **PR summary:** {{task}}
- **Full spec:**

{{spec}}

- Analysis: `{{artifactsDir}}/analyze/plan.md`
- Implementation plan: `{{artifactsDir}}/implement/plan.md`

## Review criteria

1. **Alignment** — does the diff match the spec? Files named in the spec should be the only files changed (plus strictly required import updates). If scope drifted, **REJECT**.
2. **Acceptance criteria** — every bullet in the spec's Acceptance block must be satisfied. If not, REJECT.
3. **Behavior-locking tests (PR1)** — still green? If a move/split broke them, the split is wrong, REJECT.
4. **No shims** — the user explicitly chose hard breaks for public exports (PR4, PR13). If a re-export shim was added "for safety", REJECT.
5. **Line limits** — for split PRs (3, 5, 6, 9), every new file ≤500 lines. If any file is larger, REJECT.
6. **Layering (CRITICAL for Tier B, PR10–PR13)** — `@converge/core` is the programmatic interface; `@converge/cli` is the terminal-facing shell; a future web UI must be able to integrate directly with `core` without touching `cli` or `display`. Run these audits and **REJECT** on any hit:
   - `grep -rn "@converge/display\|@converge/cli" packages/core/src` → no matches (core never imports CLI-layer packages)
   - `grep -n "@converge/display\|@converge/cli" packages/core/package.json` → no matches
   - `grep -rn "process\.exit\|process\.stdout\.write\|process\.stderr\.write" packages/core/src` → no matches
   - `grep -rn "console\.\(log\|error\|warn\|info\)" packages/core/src | grep -v ".test.ts"` → no matches
   - `grep -rn "@converge/display" packages/scheduler/src packages/journal/src 2>/dev/null` → no matches
7. **Style** — matches existing codebase conventions.

## Steps

1. `git diff --stat` — confirm only spec-scoped files changed.
2. `git diff` — read the full diff.
3. Re-run `pnpm test` to confirm green.
4. Compare diff against each Acceptance bullet.

## Output

Write `{{artifactsDir}}/review/report.md`:
- If acceptable: `APPROVED` on its own line, followed by brief notes.
- If not: `REJECTED` on its own line, followed by specific, actionable feedback so the implement phase knows what to fix.
